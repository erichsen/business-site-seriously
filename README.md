# Business Site

We were tasked with creating a business website, and I turned to one of my interests which is golf.
I settled with an image instead of a video, but I will definitely make sure to try that more going forward, since I really enjoy it myself on websites.

I started out making a sketch on a piece of paper, just a very rough one to jot down my ideas on how I wanted it to look.
Then I made a nicer version in Canva, also looking for some inspiration from other templates.

After that I started coding the foundation in html and doing the css simultanously.
I find it hard to get the hero section working properly, with no gaps and also making the image look good, but I finally got there. 
And the luxury section was easier and then the form section, spend some time getting the form to look okey, and I'm fine with the result.

If I had more time, I would add some more animations and fades to make the site look a bit more alive and not so static.
